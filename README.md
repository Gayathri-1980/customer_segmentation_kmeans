# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering :

This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their behavioral and demographic data.
Businesses can use these segments to improve marketing, retention strategies, and personalized targeting.

## Project Overview :

The goal of this project is to identify meaningful customer groups by analyzing patterns in:

1. Spending behavior

2. Demographics

3. Usage metrics

4. Interaction history

Using unsupervised machine learning (K-Means), the project uncovers natural clusters and visualizes them clearly.


## Key Steps in the Notebook :

1. Load & explore dataset

2. Handle missing values & normalize features

3. Use Elbow Method to find optimal K

4. Apply K-Means clustering

5. Visualize clusters using Matplotlib/Seaborn

6. Interpret customer segment characteristics

## Results :

* Customers are grouped into distinct behavioral segments.

* Visual cluster plots highlight spending patterns & demographic differences.

* The model provides actionable insights for marketing and customer strategy.

## Technologies Used :

* Python

* Pandas

* NumPy

* Scikit-Learn

* Matplotlib

* Seaborn

* Google Colab
